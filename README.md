BimlGen
=======

BimlGen is a basic C# WPF application used to generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Intelligence_Markup_Language">BIML</a> files using SQL Server Managemet Objects (SMO).  The application connects to a database and gathers metadata using SQL SMO to build a BIML (XML) file that can be used to generate SSIS Packages.

**Note**: For this to work, you must have SQL SMO installed in your local environment.  The latest version of SQL SMO can be downloaded as part of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29065">SQL Server 2012 Feature Pack</a>.
